    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Japanese-style Mapo Tofu dish is a staple in my weekly 
        rotation of dishes since it can be cooked in under 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sauce has a gravy-like texture and is savory and aromatic.
        It provides a good, hearty meal when eaten with rice.
